# Welcome to my personal GitHub account ðŸ¤—

My name is Luis Yago FernÃ¡ndez and I'm a ðŸ”® __Web Developer__ ðŸ”®

## About me

I am a __Psych Major__ turned __developer__, based in Madrid, Spain ðŸŒž. Throughout my life I've always been into Do-It-Yourself culture. So, during the 2020 lockdown, I started applying this self-teaching drive to learn some JavaScript.

My first learning roadmap was oriented around the __MERN stack__ technologies, and my first professional experiences were as a JavaScript frontend developer working with __Vue__, __React__ and __Angular__. I'm an enthusiast of elegant code, putting love into the details and keeping up with the state of the art of the JavaScript ecosystem; and I guess I'm good at finding joy while I learn.

## I have worked with...

+ JavaScript
+ TypeScript
+ VUE and Vite
+ Angular
+ React
+ NextJS
+ Nuxt
+ Svelte and SvelteKit
+ HTML, CSS, SASS, PostCSS
+ I've tested my apps with Cypress, Jest, Vitest, Playwright
+ Git, GitHub, GitLab
+ Azure & Jira

## I know the basics...

+ Node
+ ExpressJs
+ SQL databases
+ NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
+ Kotlin
