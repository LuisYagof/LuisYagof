# Welcome to my personal GitHub account 🤗

My name is Luis Yago Fernández and I'm a 🔮 __Full Stack Developer__ 🔮

## About me

I am a __Psych Major__ turned __web developer__, based in Madrid, Spain 🌞. Throughout my life I've always been into Do-It-Yourself culture. So, during the COVID-19 lockdown, I started applying this self-teaching drive to learn some JavaScript.

My first learning roadmap was oriented around the __MERN stack__ technologies, and my first professional experiences were as a frontend developer working with __Angular__ and __VUE__. I'm very passionate about good, efficient coding, user-oriented interfaces and learning new technologies and I guess I'm good at finding joy while I learn.

## I handle myself with...

+ JavaScript
+ TypeScript
+ VUE
+ Angular
+ React
+ HTML5 & CSS3
+ SASS / SCSS / PostCSS
+ Testing with Cypress & Jest
+ Vite / Webpack
+ Version-Control w/ GIT & GitHub & GitLab
+ Azure & Jira for task planning and traceability

## I know the basics...

+ Node
+ ExpressJs
+ NoSQL (MongoDB & Mongoose)
+ SQL (MySQL)
+ Firebase (Realtime Database)
+ REST architecture & RESTful APIs
+ Linux environment

## I want to learn...

+ EVERYTHING 🔮🌍🌌 haha

## I'm defined by my...

+ Organization
+ Detail-orientation
+ Learning autonomy
+ Ability to work under pressure
+ Communication skills
+ Flexibility
+ Teamwork abilities
